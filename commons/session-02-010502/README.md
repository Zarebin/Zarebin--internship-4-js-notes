# How to become a 10X engineer
To be a good and great engineer you need to do some self-improvements. An improved memory is one of those. To do so you can use Spaced Repitition method. Some softwares help you to use this technique like Anki. Find the links below to read more about this improvement and how to download Anki and also use shared decks to import in Anki software.

# Linux apps
We want to introduce some great linux apps each session.

## Yakuake
Yakuake is a drop-down terminal emulator based on KDE Konsole technology. 
![yakuake](https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/yakuake/yakuake.png)
To install you can use the following command:
```
sudoÂ apt install yakuake
```

## htop
htop is a cross-platform interactive process viewer.

htop allows scrolling the list of processes vertically and horizontally to see their full command lines and related information like memory and CPU consumption. Also system wide information, like load average or swap usage, is shown.

The information displayed is configurable through a graphical setup and can be sorted and filtered interactively.

Tasks related to processes (e.g. killing and renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.

# Static file serving and directory listing
## http.server in python
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/55053143/11140790
- ```python -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /path/to/dir```
or
```python -m http.server --directory web```
- then you can share it with  --> http://your-ip-address:8000

## serve in nodejs
Powerful server for Node.js that just works so you can focus on your awesome project.

- installation
```
npm i serve --global 
serve
```
- To run the serve in a different port:
```
serve -l port-number
```

- If there is an index.html file where we are serving, you see its content by default.
- You can use it to move some static content like files from one computer to another (which can access your ip)
