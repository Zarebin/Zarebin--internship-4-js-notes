### htop
htop is a cross-platform interactive process viewer.

htop allows scrolling the list of processes vertically and horizontally to see their full command lines and related information like memory and CPU consumption. Also system wide information, like load average or swap usage, is shown.

The information displayed is configurable through a graphical setup and can be sorted and filtered interactively.

Tasks related to processes (e.g. killing and renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.
